💧Water Quality Prediction – RMS
This project focuses on predicting multiple water quality parameters using machine learning, specifically a MultiOutputRegressor with a RandomForestRegressor. It was developed as part of the AICTE Virtual Internship – June 2025, sponsored by Shell in partnership with Edunet Foundation under the Skills4Future initiative.

📘 Project Description
Access to clean and safe water is a fundamental global need. This project addresses the challenge of monitoring water quality by building a predictive model capable of estimating several key chemical indicators from water quality datasets.

Key Highlights:

Preprocessed real-world water quality datasets

Implemented multi-target regression using scikit-learn

Built a pipeline using MultiOutputRegressor(RandomForestRegressor())

Evaluated performance using standard regression metrics

🧪 Tools & Technologies
Python 3.12

Pandas, NumPy – Data wrangling

Scikit-learn – Modeling and evaluation

Matplotlib, Seaborn – Visualization

Jupyter Notebook – Development and experimentation

🔬 Predicted Water Quality Parameters
The model predicts the following water quality indicators:

NH₄ – Ammonium

BSK5 – Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD5)

Colloids

O₂ – Dissolved Oxygen

NO₃, NO₂ – Nitrate & Nitrite

SO₄ – Sulfate

PO₄ – Phosphate

CL – Chloride

📊 Model Evaluation
The model's performance was assessed using:

R² Score – Measures the proportion of variance explained by the model

Mean Squared Error (MSE) – Measures average prediction error
