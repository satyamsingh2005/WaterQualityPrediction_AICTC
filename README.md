## ðŸ’§Water Quality Prediction â€“ RMS
This project focuses on predicting multiple water quality parameters using machine learning, specifically a MultiOutputRegressor with a RandomForestRegressor. Using time-series measurements (e.g., pH, nitrates, turbidity), the model forecasts future water quality at downstream locations.

## ðŸ“˜ Project Description
Access to clean and safe water is a fundamental global need. This project addresses the challenge of monitoring water quality by building a predictive model capable of estimating several key chemical indicators from real-world datasets.

## ðŸ”¹Key Highlights:

- Preprocessed real-world water quality datasets
- Implemented multi-target regression using scikit-learn
- Built a pipeline using MultiOutputRegressor(RandomForestRegressor())
- Evaluated performance using standard regression metrics
